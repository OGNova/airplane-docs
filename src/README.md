Airplane is a utilitarian and administration assistant for Discord. It's a bot that was built to be highly configurable, and allow server admins to modify functionality based on the requirements of individual servers. The freely hosted version of airplane is private, and only added on high-traffic servers. airplane is [open-source](https://github.com/OGNova/airplane).

## User Testimonials

### Nuna - Community Manager

> I’ve been exposed to many different bots, while all were wonderful, I’ve found Airplane to be the best. Training my moderators how to use this bot is simple and easy, and the commands we have access to are both useful and fun. I feel that since we’ve been using Airplane, our Discord has grown exponentially. The lack of crashes and bugs with the Airplane bot is one of the key things for any Discord, as well as the tracking aspects. We can track name changes, role changes, our trainee mod’s activities, all in clear and concise logs that are easy to follow and well thought out. All in all, a well built bot that can be used on large servers as well as smaller ones with ease.

### Gullus - Community Manager

> Airplane has helped me manage a server of 30,000+ users, the bot's layout is simple, easy to learn, and easy to use. Before Airplane we had to utilize 5 bots to keep the server running. Overall, with the dedication and help from the devs, the bot has improved the server more than any other bot we've seen.

### Xenitran - Community Manager

> The bot has improved the workload of moderators, by automatically taking care of some spam, censoring and is generally contributing to a much more smooth and accurate handling of people and infractions. It gives us time to focus on more complicated matters and see to better security of the server.

### Swagger Souls - Community Owner, Discord Partner, and Content Creator

> The bot is extremely useful in dealing with spammers, rule breakers, and ultimately takes a lot pressure and stress off of the staff team, allowing them to focus more of their time on incidents and issues that deserve their attention! The logging system is extremely useful, and we consistently use it to make sure rule breakers are dealt with, and the staff are operating within their jurisdiction.
